    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup oil</li>
        <li>2 small or 1 large onion, thinly sliced (~250g)</li>
        <li> 4 tbsp ginger & garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 lb chicken with bone, cut into medium pieces</li>
           
        <li> 3/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp salt (to taste)</li>
        <li> 1 pack Shan Bombay Biryani Masala</li>
        <li>  1/2 pack Shan Sindhi Biryani Masala</li>
        <li>3 russet potatoes, cut into 1/2" slices (~550g)</li>
        <li>1-2 large lemons, thinly sliced (100-150g)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dried aloo bukhara (plum)</li>
        <li>6 tomatoes, cut into thin slices (600g)</li>
        <li>6-8 green chilies, cut into long slices (serrano preferred)</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh mint</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Rice</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>cups Basmati rice (800g)</li>
        <li>12 cups water</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Prep</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, prepare all the ingredients</li>
          <li>Wash and rinse the rice 5-6 times until the water becomes clearer, and soak it in cold water</li>
          <li>Slice and chop all the vegetables, and gather everything else in front of you</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Biryani Masala</h3>
        <ol>
        <li> Heat the oil in a large pot</li>
        <li> Add the onion and cook it on medium high heat for 8-10 minutes until it becomes golden</li>
        <li>Add the ginger & garlic paste and saute for 1-2 minutes until it no longer smells raw</li>
        <li>Add the chicken, and cook on high heat for 5 minutes. This will give the chicken a light brown color and get rid of the
        raw smell</li>
        <li>Add the yogurt, salt, Bombay Biryani Masala, Sindhi Biryani Masala, and potatoes. Stir and fry on high heat for 2-3
        minutes to toast the spices and make them fragrant</li>
        <li> Add the sliced lemon</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the potatoes are just cooked through (but not fully soft). This can take
        anywhere from 10-20 minutes depending on how big your potatoes are cut. Check after every 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Halfway through cooking the potatoes, add the dried aloo bukhara and green chilies, and stir them in</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are just cooked through, remove the lid. Keep the heat on low, and layer the sliced tomatoes on top of
        the masala. Sprinkle 2 tbsp each of the cilantro and mint on top (you won't use all of the cilantro and mint in this
        step)</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with the lid and cook for about 10 min on low heat to soften tomatoes</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and cook for 2-3 more minutes on medium heat. Then turn off the heat</li>
        <li> At this point, the biryani masala should be very fragrant, the potatoes should be fully cooked through, and there should
        be a good amount of masala without being watery. If there's too much liquid, cook down a bit more without a lid</li>
        <li>Cover the masala and keep it hot</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Parboiling rice:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Follow the instructions given on the package of the rice to boil it in water with salt, but reduce the cooking time to
            ~75% and check frequently after the 50% mark</li>
        <li>To cook basmati rice, I add the soaked rice to boiling water, and cook it for ~8-10 minutes before draining</li>
        <li> rice should be just cooked through (i.e., no raw middle) but should still have a firmness / bite to it.</li>
        <li>Drain the water by transferring the rice to a rice colander</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Layering:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To a clean, large heavy bottomed Dutch oven pot, add a third of the rice on the bottom. </li>
                <li>  Drizzle over some food color
            (mixed in water) and sprinkle over a third of the remaining cilantro and mint</li>
            <li> Then add a layer of half of the biryani masala</li>
            <li> Repeat with another third of the rice, food color, cilantro, mint.</li>
            <li> Add the remaining biryani masala, and add a third and
            final layer of rice, food color, cilantro and mint on top</li>
        </ol>
<h3>Steaming / Dum:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Use the back of a large spoon / dowel to poke 3-4 holes through the layers of the biryani</li>
    <li>Wrap the lid of the pot in a large tea towel and cover the pot. Place it on a small burner on medium heat, and put some
    weight on top of the lid (e.g., a mortar and pestle). After 5 minutes, reduce the heat to the lowest setting</li>
    <li> Allow the biryani to steam for ~20 minutes. You will know it is done if you slightly lift the lid and see steam escaping</li>
    <li> Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 5 minutes</li>
    <li> Carefully and very gently mix the biryani. Use a large metal spoon or rice fluffer, and mix in a scooping motion just
     5-6 times. The biryani does not have to be fully mixed; overmixing will risk breaking the rice</li>
    <li> If you are serving the biryani in a different dish, you can skip the "mixing" and simply scoop the biryani into the
    dish, making sure to dig deep with each scoop. This will naturally mix the layers</li>
    <li>Your biryani is now ready to be devoured!</li>
</ol>
